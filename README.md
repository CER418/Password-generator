## A Simple CLI Password Generator
#### Inspired by the build in password generator in the search engine DuckDuckGo.

- Easily create passwords from the command line.
- Python is great, but if anyone would like to write the code in bash I would highly appreciate it <3
- Feel free to submit pull requests for features.

### Usage
There are three different strengths of passwords that can be generated (weak, average, strong):
```
password [strength] [length]

Example:
    password strong 32
    password average 8
```

### Strength
You can check the strength of the password by, for example, using [Cygnius Password Strength Test](https://apps.cygnius.net/passtest/).
